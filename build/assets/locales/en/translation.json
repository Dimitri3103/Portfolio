Added to this is a certain taste for teamwork. \n \n I currently have about 10 months of professional experience in areas such as: \n - Design and the development of web and mobile applications;\n- Agile project management.\nThis experience was acquired through the various internships that I completed and at the end of which my managers have always praised my learning skills, my faculties of adaptation and integration but also my rigor in respecting deadlines. \n \n Ultimately, I would describe myself as someone dynamic and constantly looking for new challenges that allow me to increase my practical skills while developing my creativity.",
